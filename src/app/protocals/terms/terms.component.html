  situation.
  We define spam as the sending of Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE), Unsolicited Bulk Email (UBE) or Unsolicited

  policy. Commercial advertising and/or bulk emails or faxes may only be sent to recipients who have “opted-in” to
  receive messages. They must include a legitimate return address and reply-to address, the sender's physical address,
  and an opt-out method in the footer of the email or fax. Upon request by us, conclusive proof of opt-in may be
  required for an email address or fax number.
  If we determine the services in question are being used in association with spam, we will re-direct, suspend, or
  cancel any web site hosting, domain registration, email boxes or other applicable services until customer responds.
  The registrant or customer will be required to respond by email to us stating that they will cease to send spam and/or
  have spam sent on their behalf. In the event we determine the abuse has not stopped after services have been restored
  the first time, we may terminate the hosting and email boxes associated with the domain name in question.
  We encourage all customers and recipients of email generated from our products and services to report suspected spam.
  Suspected abuse can be reported by email admin@{{MALL_NAME}}.com

  frames may range from five (5) business days to a full billing cycle, or longer. In the event a refund is issued to
  your Payment Method and the payment provider, payment processor or individual issuing bank associated with your
  Payment Method imposes any limitations on refunds, including but not limited to, limitations as to the timing of the
  refund or the number of refunds allowed, then {{MALL_NAME}}, in its sole and absolute discretion, reserves the right to
  issue the refund in the form of an in-store credit. {{MALL_NAME}} also has the right, but not the obligation, to offer an
  in-store credit for customers seeking refunds, even if there are no limitations on refunds imposed by the Payment
  Method. For the avoidance of doubt, any and all refunds processed via the issuance of in-store creditsare solely
  within {{MALL_NAME}}’s discretion and are not available at customer request. In order to ensure that you do not experience
  an interruption or loss of Services, most Services offer an automatic renewal option. The automatic renewal option
  automatically renews the applicable Service for a renewal period equal in time to the most recent service period,
  except for domain names which will renew for the original service period. For example, for products other
  than domains, if your last service period is for one year, your renewal period will be for one year. While the details
  of the automatic renewal option vary from Service to Service, the Services that offer an automatic renewal option
  treat it as the default setting. Therefore, unless you disable the automatic renewal option, {{MALL_NAME}} will
  automatically renew the applicable Service when it comes up for renewal and will take payment from the Payment Method
  you have on file with {{MALL_NAME}} at {{MALL_NAME}}’s then current rates, which you acknowledge and agree may be higher or
  lower than the rates for the original service period. In order to see the renewal settings applicable to you and your
  Services, simply log into your members area and find the respective account. You may enable or disable the automatic
  renewal option at any time. However, should you elect to disable the automatic renewal option and fail to manually
  renew your Services before they expire, you may experience an interruption or loss of Services, and {{MALL_NAME}} shall not
  be liable to you or any third party regarding the same. In addition, {{MALL_NAME}} may participate in “recurring billing
  programs” or “account updater services” supported by your credit card provider (and ultimately dependent on your
  bank’s participation). If you are enrolled in an automatic renewal option and we are unable to successfully charge
  your existing Payment Method, your credit card provider (or your bank) may notify us of updates to your credit card
  number and/or expiration date, or they may automatically charge your new credit card on our behalf without
  notification to us. In accordance with recurring billing program requirements, in the event that we are notified of an
  update to your credit card number and/or expiration date, {{MALL_NAME}} will automatically update your payment profile on
  your behalf. {{MALL_NAME}} makes no guarantees that we will request or receive updated credit card information. You
  acknowledge and agree that it is your sole responsibility to modify and maintain your Account settings, including but
  not limited to (i) setting your renewal options and (ii) ensuring your associated Payment Method(s) are current and
  valid. Further, you acknowledge and agree that your failure to do so, may result in the interruption or loss of
  Services, and {{MALL_NAME}} shall not be liable to you or any third party regarding the same. If for any reason {{MALL_NAME}} is
  unable to charge your Payment Method for the full amount owed for the Services provided, or if {{MALL_NAME}} receives
  notification of a chargeback, reversal, payment dispute, or is charged a penalty for any fee it previously charged to
  your Payment Method, you agree that {{MALL_NAME}} may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment,
  including but not limited to, immediate cancellation, without notice to you, of any domain names or Services
  registered or renewed on your behalf. {{MALL_NAME}} also reserves the right to charge you reasonable “administrative fees”
  or “processing fees” for (i) tasks {{MALL_NAME}} may perform outside the normal scope of its Services, (ii) additional time
  and/or costs {{MALL_NAME}} may incur in providing its Services, and/or (iii) your noncompliance with this Agreement (as
  determined by {{MALL_NAME}} in its sole and absolute discretion). Typical administrative or processing fee scenarios
  include, but are not limited to (i) customer service issues that require additional personal time or attention; (ii)
  UDRP actions(s) in connection with your domain name(s) and/or disputes that require accounting or legal services,
  whether performed by {{MALL_NAME}} staff or by outside firms retained by {{MALL_NAME}}; (iii) recouping any and all costs and
  fees, including the cost of Services, incurred by {{MALL_NAME}} as the results of chargebacks or other payment disputes
  brought by you, your bank or Payment Method processor. These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to
  the Payment Method you have on file with {{MALL_NAME}}. {{MALL_NAME}} may offer product-level pricing in various
  currencies; however, transaction processing is supported only in U.S. dollars and a select number of the currency
  options displayed on this Site ("Supported Currency" or “Supported Currencies”). If the currency selected is a
  Supported Currency, then the transaction will be processed in the Supported Currency and the pricing displayed during
  the checkout process will be the actual amount processed and submitted to your bank for payment. If the currency
  selected is not a Supported Currency, then the transaction will be processed in U.S. dollars and the pricing displayed
  during the checkout process will be an estimated conversion price at the time of purchase. In either case (whether the
  currency selected is a Supported Currency or not), if the transaction is processed in a currency that differs from the
  currency of your bank account, you may be charged exchange rate conversion fees by your bank. In addition, due to time
  differences between (i) the time you complete the checkout process, (ii) the time the transaction is processed, and
  (iii) the time the transaction posts to your bank statement, the conversion rates may fluctuate, and {{MALL_NAME}} makes no
  representations or warranties that (a) the amount submitted to your bank for payment will be the same as the amount
  posted to your bank statement (in the case of a Supported Currency) or (b) the estimated conversion price will be the
  same as either the amount processed or the amount posted to your bank statement (in the case of a non-Supported
  Currency), and you agree to waive any and all claims based upon such discrepancies (including any and all claims for a
  refund based on the foregoing). In addition, regardless of the selected currency, you acknowledge and agree that you
  may be charged Value Added Tax ("VAT"), Goods and Services Tax ("GST"), or other localized fees and/or taxes, based on
  your bank and/or the country indicated in your billing address section.
  Refund Policy: For products and services eligible for a refund, you may request a full refund within thirty (30) days
  of purchase (“Refund Period”). For refunds requested after the Refund Period, an in-store credit will be issued for
  any unused time remaining on your plan. Unused time will be calculated as the number of months remaining on the
  purchase term excluding the month in which the refund is requested. In the event you purchase a product that includes
  a free domain name, if you cancel the product, the list price for the domain name will be deducted from the refund
  amount. The list price is the price of the domain name listed on {{MALL_NAME}}’s website and is not subject to any
  promotion, discount, or other reduction in price.
  In no event will you be eligible for more than one refund of the same product. 
  (B) INTERNATIONAL PAYMENT OPTIONS
  {{MALL_NAME}} offers a variety of alternative international payment options through a variety of International Payment
  Providers (“IPP”). In the event you select an IPP, you represent that you have already agreed to any and all of the
  IPP’s applicable customer service agreements in advance of completing your transaction at {{MALL_NAME}}. You also agree to
  allow the IPP to debit the full amount of your purchase from the selected bank account, e-wallet account (including
  credit card(s), bank account(s), or other allowed payment method(s) linked to your e-wallet account) or any other type
  of account associated with the selected IPP (including but not limited to, prepaid cards and mobile payments),
  collectively “Funding Sources”. In addition, you agree to allow the selected IPP to debit, if applicable, an “Exchange
  Rate Conversion Fee”, as well as any other fees or charges applicable to your agreement with the IPP (collectively,
  the “IPP Fees”), from your Funding Sources. You understand and agree that IPP Fees are subject to change at any time
  by the IPP without notice to you by {{MALL_NAME}}.
  It is your responsibility to keep your Funding Sources current and funded. You acknowledge and agree that (i) the IPP
  reserves the right to decline a transaction for any reason (including, but not limited to, payments that fail to go
  through as a result of your Funding Sources no longer existing or not holding available/sufficient funds) and (ii) in
  such event, neither the IPP nor {{MALL_NAME}} shall be liable to you or any third party regarding the same. You acknowledge
  that {{MALL_NAME}} will not attempt to fulfill the Services purchased by you until {{MALL_NAME}} receives confirmation of
  payment from the IPP through its associated payment processor. You acknowledge there may be a gap of several hours or
  days between the time you place an order and the time the IPP confirms payment through its associated payment
  processor. If {{MALL_NAME}} does not receive confirmation of payment from the IPP through its associated payment processor
  within thirty (30) days from when the order is placed, your order may be cancelled, at which time you will need to
  commence the purchase process again. In the event that you would like to cancel payment for a pending transaction, you
  may cancel the order through your {{MALL_NAME}} account. Payments received on previously cancelled orders will be
  automatically refunded to the original Payment Method when possible.
  If, at the time {{MALL_NAME}} receives confirmation of payment from the IPP (through its associated payment processor),
  either (i) the Services (including domain names) are no longer available for purchase; or (ii) a pending order has
  been cancelled in our systems; or (iii) the confirmation of payment does not match the dollar amount of the pending
  order, and as a result your purchase is either over-funded or under-funded, {{MALL_NAME}} may automatically issue a partial
  refund (in the case of over-funding) or a full refund (in the case of under-funding) to your Funding Source. If the
  IPP (or its associated payment processor) imposes refund limitations of any kind, {{MALL_NAME}} reserves the right to issue
  refunds to an in-store credit balance. If you receive a full refund, you will need to begin the purchase process
  again. You acknowledge and agree that the IPP reserves the right not to refund IPP Fees associated with a refunded
  transaction. Accordingly, any refunds issued by {{MALL_NAME}} will be net of the IPP Fees unless otherwise specified.
  (C) IN-STORE CREDIT BALANCES
  In the event that your Account contains an in-store credit balance, you may apply any available credit balance to any
  future purchase in your Account. In the event that your Account contains an in-store credit balance, you hereby
  authorize {{MALL_NAME}} to apply any available credit balance to any outstanding administrative fees, chargebacks or other
  fees related to your Account. In the event that your default Payment Method fails for an automated billing in
  connection with the processing of any Service renewals, {{MALL_NAME}} may utilize any available in-store credit balance if
  there are enough funds to cover the entire transaction. Regardless of the amount of in-store credit available in your
  account, {{MALL_NAME}} is not responsible for the loss of products resulting from an inability to collect funds from your
  default Payment Methods or the in-store credit. In-store credits will be applied based on the currency selected in the
  shopping cart at the time of purchase (or renewal). If you have more than one in-store credit, then the credits will
  be processed according to the age of the credit, with the oldest in-store credit being applied first. If additional
  funds are required to complete the purchase or renewal, credits held in a non-selected currency will be converted
  using {{MALL_NAME}}’s daily exchange rate based on the age of the credit (oldest to newest) until (i) enough funds are
  allocated to complete the transaction, or (ii) there is no available balance left in your account. You understand and
  agree that at the time of conversion, {{MALL_NAME}} may also impose an additional administrative fee to compensate for the
  risks and costs associated with providing currency conversion services.
  You can verify your available in-store credit balance at any time by logging into “Manage Your Account” or through the
  shopping cart on the {{MALL_NAME}} website. You acknowledge that in-store credit balances are non-transferrable, may only
  be used in the Account in which they were acquired and may expire. Complimentary in-store credits will expire two
  years after issuance. In the event that {{MALL_NAME}} terminates your Account, you acknowledge and agree that any remaining
  available in-store credit balance will be forfeited.
  You also acknowledge that funds available in your in-store credit balance will be held by {{MALL_NAME}} and will not accrue
  or pay interest for your behalf. To the extent any interest may accrue, you understand and agree that {{MALL_NAME}} shall
  be entitled to receive and keep any such amounts to cover costs associated with supporting the in-store credit balance
  functionality.
