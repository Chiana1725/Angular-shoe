                <p>Welcome to our online store. Our goal is that you feel as comfortable using our website as you are
                  shopping in your local mall. Whenever you purchase product(s) from our website, we take the issue of
                  security seriously. Each time you enter your credit card number, your billing and shipping information
                  when shopping, we will use the industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to prevent the
                  information from being intercepted.</p>
                <p><strong>Our Commitment To Privacy</strong></p>
                <p>Your privacy is important to us. To keep your privacy safer, we provide this notice, explaining our
                  online information practices and choices that you can make about the way your information is collected
                  and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point
                  where personally identifiable information may be requested.</p>
                <p>The Information We Collect:<br>
                  This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the our website. On some pages, you

                  Information. On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you order a
                  gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's
                  address. In this circumstance, the types of personal information collected are Name, Address, Phone

                <p>The Way We Use Information:<br>
                  We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order.
                  We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that
                  order. We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the
                  product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the
                  extent necessary to complete that order. We use non-identifying and aggregate information to design
                  our website better and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number
                  of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women
                  filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify
                  those individuals. Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to
                  us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to
                  opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>
